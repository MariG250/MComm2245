<h1>Questions and Answers</h1>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="title_1">Do you take commissions?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Yes, I do take art commissions! I absolutely love creating custom pieces for people and bringing their visions to life. Whether it's a portrait of a loved one, a favorite pet, or a stunning landscape, I'm always up for the challenge. I work in a variety of mediums, including acrylics, watercolors, and digital art, so whatever your preference, I've got you covered. Let's collaborate and create something truly amazing together!</p>
<p>Don't forget I can also work on Photography, simplistic 2D and 3D Animation, and have a basic skills to editing videos in Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>

<p><strong>How will I pay if I buy a commission?</strong></p>
<p>As of now, I accept a few various forms of payment, such as Cash App, PayPal, and bank transfers. We can discuss which option works best for you and make the payment process as smooth as possible. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and I'll be happy to assist you further.</p>
<p><strong>What art do you do?</strong></p>
<p>I have come to the conclusion of owning my skills in the cartoon or semi-realistic art style. Yet my mediums vary from traditional and digital art (I lean mostly towards digital). If you have a specific type of art or style in mind, don't hesitate to let me know. I'm happy to discuss your ideas and create something unique for you. </p>
<p><strong>Whats your price on the artwork you do?</strong><br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since I want to gain experience in working with clients, I range rather lower than most artists. I choose to do so because I want others to take advantage and I hope to eventually raise my prices if I ever gain a following. Again, thank you all for being intrested in what I do!</p>
