<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My Name is Mariana Garcia</h2>
<p>An artist who was born and raised in a desert known as New Mexico! The state itself is already known for its reputation for the arts! Growing up, I always loved to draw. When I was five, my older brother Esteban Garcia inspired me to develop and grow with my art. Ever since then, I have eventually developed my skills and now am pursuing this in college. My goal as an artist is to obtain a bachelor's and be in the industry of animation!</p>
<p dir="ltr">â€‹</p>
<p dir="ltr">The reason why I plan to work as an animator is because of the passion I have for the shows I grew up with, and admire every bit of it. I am slowly learning the skills for animation; however, this is a specific type of skill that I am still trying to obtain. Not only am I trying to develop as an animator, but an artist as well.</p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr">I am lucky enough to have space in my house for me to create art. Not only that, I work hard to have lots of decent equipment. For those who want my art as soon as possible, I tend to take my time to paint because I want to be satisfied with the art I make as well. That doesn't mean I can reply immediately.</p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr">Thanks to my supportive family, I am still on my journey towards my dream job. My goal for this website is not only to gain more of a following, but gain more skills along the way with any software I come across! If you have any more questions for me, either check out the FAQ or contact me!</p>
