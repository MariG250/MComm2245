<h1>Blog</h1>
<h2>Hey everyone! I am thrilled to announce the launch of my new art blog!</h2>
<p><a href="https://com28736.wordpress.com/">Click here for my blogs!</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">As an artist, I am always looking for ways to reach a wider audience and share my work with more people. With my art blog I recently made, I can do just that! My blog will feature a variety of my artwork and my journey as a college student who also wants to get into the animation industry. Whether you're an art lover or just someone who appreciates creativity, there will be something for everyone to enjoy.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the best things about my art blog is that it's easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection. You can view my work from the comfort of your own home, at any time that's convenient for you. I will range from sharing the daily challenges I face as a student, my newest mediums, updates on my progression, and my pieces of art that is accompanied by a description as to what it means so you can learn more about my inspiration and creative process. In the future, I plan to host virtual exhibitions that will give you a more immersive experience. You will feel like you're walking through a gallery and interacting with each piece. I am so excited to share my art with all of you and I hope you will join me on this journey. Don't forget to catch up on my latest blog posts and share them with your friends and family. Let's inspire each other to create and appreciate art!</p>
