<h1>Education</h1>
<p>As Mentioned on my About page<a href="index (2).html"> here</a>, I am currently attending The University of New Mexico. As of now, I am close to obtaining my bachelors in animation. I have worked for so long to get to this point, and I might forget to update this website if I ever get my Bacheelor's. For those reading, I will graduate in the Spring of 2024. What I do have is a certificate in the fine arts that I have required in Central of New Mexico Community College. </p>
<p>I have gained the experience of many softwares given to me by schools and have side hustles that I have done as well. I have done commisions with clients in the past and now am commited to doing this side hustle in making art for others.</p>
