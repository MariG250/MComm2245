<h2>Profile</h2>

<p>A university student who is striving to be in the field of animation. I work hard and have multiple softwares that I learned to use for the 
  past few years i've been in school. I heavily work with Maya and Adobe, as well as other software I toggled with for years. I can adapt 
quickly and can be a teamplayer, I am willing to learn and work hard for this industry. To learn more about me, see what I am <a href="index (2).html">ABOUT</a>.</p>
<p>I would love for you to be a part of my journey on becoming an animator. So, feel free to follow me on social media and see what I have to offer. Thank you for your support, and I hope you enjoy exploring my website!</p>
<p>For those looking for a commision, you have come to the right place! These are the following softwares I have learned thus far:</p>
<p>3D Animation</p>
<p>Graphic Design</p>
<p>Traditional Art</p>
<p>Digital Art</p>
<p>Photography</p>
<p>Editing*</p>
<p>Motion Graphics*</p>
<p>*Disclaimer, I am limited to my knowlege on Adobe Premiere Pro or After Effects, so if you aren't good with editing videos whatsoever and havee no knowlege of these softwares, I am the right person to go to. Other than that, I would reccomend others who are solely experts to the Adobe editing software if you are looking to request something that is advanced, everything else listed without the star  is my strong suit!</p>
